# About this project
This is my first JavaFX Rich Internet Application.
I was probably choosing the wrong thing as I did a cracking application using swing, which is pretty dead. I feel like switching to JavaFX is a pretty good idea.(apparently better than swing)

I've also taken some notes here on this file: [NOTES](/NOTES.md)

It's just to gain some experience with the FX library, which might as well help with my java native application development.
